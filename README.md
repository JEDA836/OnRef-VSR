To validate the advantages of our method in both speed and performance, we first release a partial version of our model along with its training weights. This version excludes certain core modules, but it is sufficient for preliminary evaluation of our efficiency and performance gains. The complete model and full training weights will be made publicly available in subsequent releases.
